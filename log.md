## 2026-07-12 — Initial build

- Explored `deutsche-bahn-data` submodule: collects per-station-stop IRIS timetable data (plan + fchg) every 6 h into HuggingFace dataset `piebro/deutsche-bahn-data`; monthly processed releases; no journey/routing concept.
- Decisions (with user): journeys via public transport.rest wrapper; historical delays from HF raw data (no DB API key); FastAPI + DuckDB + vanilla JS; booking = bahn.de deep link.
- Scaffolded uv project: `pyproject.toml`, `pipeline/`, `app/`, `static/`.
- `pipeline/build_delay_db.py`: downloads last 8 days of raw parquet via `snapshot_download` (skips existing), reuses submodule's `process_files_to_temp` XML parser, adapts the monthly-release merge SQL to a rolling window, writes `data/delays.parquet`. Window ends yesterday (today's uploads incomplete); oldest day is boundary-only for cross-midnight trains.
- **Pivot**: v6.db.transport.rest returned 503 on all endpoints (v5 too). Switched to bahn.de web API directly (`/web/api/reiseloesung/orte` for locations, POST `/web/api/angebote/fahrplan` for journeys) — same upstream that db-vendo wraps. Removed `app/transport_rest.py`, added `app/bahn_api.py`. Bonus: Berlin-local naive times (no tz conversion) and ticket prices in the response.
- `app/delays.py`: DuckDB query matching train legs to history by `train_number` (zero-strip both sides) + padded arrival EVA + time-of-day proximity (±120 min, closest per day); arrival delay computed from `arrival_planned_time`/`arrival_change_time`; cancelled days excluded from avg but counted.
- `app/main.py`: normalizes bahn.de `verbindungen`/`verbindungsAbschnitte` into frontend-friendly journeys; `delayScore` = final leg avg arrival delay; `maxLegAvgDelay` = worst leg.
- Frontend: bahn.de-style UI, autocomplete, color-coded delay badges (green <3 / yellow 3–9 / red ≥10 / gray no-data), "n/7 Tage" coverage, cancellation note, sort by departure or least delay, bahn.de booking deep link.
- Smoke run `--days 3`: 2 days, ~440k stops/day, avg 3.6–4.1 min. Full `--days 8`: 7 days (2026-07-05..11), 3.1M rows.
- Verified end-to-end: curl (7/7 days matched on Berlin→München ICEs) + Playwright browser flow (search, badges, sort reorder, booking URL, no console errors).
- Docs added: README.md, feature_list.md, progress.md, this log. Repo initialized as git with `deutsche-bahn-data` as a proper submodule.
